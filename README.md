#Seesaw Free for All#

This is a rough sketch of a game idea I have. It requires two people to play. Things move fast! Can you rule the playground?

**How to play**

* Requires two players and one keyboard.
* The left player uses a and d to move and s to jump. The right player uses j and l to move and k to jump.
* The goal is to make your opponent's side of the seesaw touch the ground to score a point.
* Power-ups and power-downs drop from the sky. Will you pick them up?
* Use the arrow keys to move the fulcrum up and down for an additional challenge and potential fight for control of the keyboard.
* Two people. One keyboard. Awesome.

**Notes**

* This version of the game has no winning condition and goes on continuously.
* There is a start menu scene in the project but it isn't configured. Load the main scene to play the game.
